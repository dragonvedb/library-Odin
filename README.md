# library-Odin

26 of March:

Excited and a little scared to begin this project because it sounds like maybe the first really tough one. I know I have all the knowlege I need to handle it, but not sure where to begin, or what the best course of action is. It will force me to synthesize everything I know about HTML/CSS _and_ JavaSctipt.
It's not just about manipulating the DOM, I'll have to define custom form behaviour, store input information using object, and then use those object to create HTML elements.
