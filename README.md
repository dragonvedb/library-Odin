# library-Odin

26 of March:

Excited and a little scared to begin this project because it sounds like maybe the first really tough one. I know I have all the knowlege I need to handle it, but not sure where to begin, or what the best course of action is. It will force me to synthesize everything I know about HTML/CSS _and_ JavaSctipt.
It's not just about manipulating the DOM, I'll have to define custom form behaviour, store input information using object, and then use those object to create HTML elements.

The project is done and looks way better than I hoped. Under the hood it's pretty ugly though, but seems to work fine. I even managed to make editing possible, which I at some point wanted to scrap, because it seemed to require too much refactoring.

The best graphic desing decision I made was adding visual 'book covers' to the cards, whose colors and font are set by the user, while the width of the 'book' and size of the font are set dynamically depending on page count / title length. The title can still overflow occasionally, or break up words in weird ways, but I'm not going to spend even more time fixing it.
